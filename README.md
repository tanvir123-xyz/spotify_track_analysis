## ðŸŽµ Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify tracks to uncover insights and trends within the music industry. The primary goal is to understand the relationships between various audio features (such as danceability, energy, and valence) and a track's popularity. By visualizing these connections, the project aims to identify the key characteristics of popular songs.

*Key Objectives:*
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Spotify tracks dataset.
- Visualize audio features and their distributions.
- Analyze the correlation between different track attributes and popularity.
- Identify trends in music genres and track durations.
